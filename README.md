# T4-Forms

A Project allowing the making of forms through webhooks. Fivem & Discord Related.
  - Initaily going to entail a UI in-game.
  - An Ticket based ecosytem to store data.
  - Taking inspiration from @OKOKScripts/Fivem

# Project Usage
The project is simply a form used for the remainded of my course. It uses simple UI features and also hosts a basic form design. Following a template to guide me through the process and using various react tools to make the application work.

We have toast notification hosted as well that informs the user that they have submitted the work.
  - Due to very minimal experience with the language, I am limited to the amount of things I can achieve, but it does not stop me. I will make the button become a validation if the form is not filled out.
